## Steps
1. Listen and look for clues 
2. Draw a large example with duplicates, not sorted if not said
3. Come up with a brute-force
4. Optimize with DIY and BUD(brute-force, avoid unnecessary and duplicate work) approaches
5. Walk through and double check with interviewer and ask if they want me to code
6. CODE - Don't spend time on writing small functions - just write a valid function name that will explain that I am getting this e.g., min/max value
7. Test using simple test case, then big case then edge cases
