**Notes: don't mix the `append()` and `add()`**
In array or stack,
```
append()
pop()
index(element, st, end)
sort()
reverse()
remove()
arr[i]
```

Stack prime functions,
```
add()
set1.intersaction(set2) or set1 & set2
set1.difference(set2) or set1 - set2
```

**for - common ideas**
```
#for i in range(start, end, diff):
for i in range(len(arr)-1, -1, -1):
    # this will reverse the array e.g., starting from (length of arr - 1) and then going back to 0
```
